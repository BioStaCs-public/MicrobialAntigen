# MimicNeoAI
Due to the lack of algorithms and tools for the systematic analysis of microbial mimicry antigens, we developed the MimicNeoAI pipeline, which is composed of three main components: candidate microbial antigen detection, candidate tumor neoantigen detection and prediction of neoantigens and microbial antigen mimicry!
